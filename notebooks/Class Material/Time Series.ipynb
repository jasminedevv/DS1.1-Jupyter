    "# Time Series Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives (Competencies) (5 min)\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "1. Describe what is time series\n",
    "2. Describe how can decompose the time series into trend and seasonality\n",
    "3. Learn how we can compute the monthly rate of return for a stock data set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Series Analysis\n",
    "Time series: series of data point listed in time order\n",
    "Example: Temperature during the day, number of taxi rides during a week, stock market price and ...\n",
    "Trend: Long term progression (for example increase or decrease)\n",
    "Seasonality: Patterns due to seasonal factors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review: Sort the following data frame based on date\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'Value':['100','78','129'] , 'Date':['02/20/2015','01/15/2016','08/21/2015']})\n",

    "## Activity: Obtain the trend and seasonality for air passenger dataset\n",
    "Additive model: $x(t) = trend(t) + seasonality(t) + residual(t)$\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1- Plot the number of passenger based on Month: Hint:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('AirPassengers.csv')\n",
    "df['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Month'])\n",
    "plt.plot(df['Month'], df['#Passengers'])\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "2- Set the index of data frame by Month:\n",
    "`df  = df.set_index(['Month'])`\n",
    "3- Apply the decomposition to data-frame -> Give us trend and seasonality\n",
    "`import statsmodels.api as sm`\n",
    "`decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(df, model='additive')`\n",
    "4- Plot trend, seasonality and residual for passenger dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load and plot passaenger time series\n",

    "plt.plot(df['Month'], df['#Passengers'])\n",

    "## Sampling and Smoothing\n",
    "Most of the time, for time series analysis, the data has many jumps and downs.\n",
    "It is desired to have smoother version of time series.\n",
    "We have two options:\n",
    "1- Sampling the time series\n",
    "2- Smoothing the time series\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activity: Time Series Sampling and Smoothing on Apple dataset\n",
    "Task: Plot the \"Close\", which is stock market price at closing time (5:30 p.m. NY time), its sampled version and its smoothed version.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1- Load and plot Apple Stock Market dataset:\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "2- Sample this dataset and plot it:\n",
    "Hint: use `data.sample()``\n",
    "3- Smooth this time series (\"Close\"):\n",
    "Hint: use `data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Smooth the dataset\n",

    "3. We'll define a fraudulent account as one that has made more than 40 average clicks per minute. how many fraud accounts are there in this dataset? How many are students in college? Do non-government accounts have a higher probability of being fraud vs the probability of being fraudulent if they are non-government accounts?\n",
    "4. How many comments mention 'gradiva' and were there more mentions during the day or night?\n",
